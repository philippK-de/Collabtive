+ Implemented automatic update notification.
+ Completely re-written the PDF export. It now uses a custom subclass of TCPDF to directly draw the tables for the reports from arrays instead of using an HTML intermediate.
  This greatly speeds up PDF generation (esp when many lines are exported) and generates much smaller PDFs.

+ Improved the project log PDF report by merging fields, improving shading and adding automatic font stretching.
+ Added new PDF report to the "my tasks" block on the desktop. Now a user can export all his tasks to PDF.

+ Ported install.php and update.php to also use PDO
+ Replaced the Excel Export by a more robust CSV export. The excel export was based on an outdated library and not fully compatible with newer versions of Excel and OpenOffice.
  With CSV Collabtive can now export to a widely used serialisation format that can easily be read into Excel, OpenOffice, and many more.
+ Switched to using a precompiled static CSS file in production instead of dynamically compiling it at runtime. This saves many call to the php interpreter.

+ Fixed a bug preventing people from uploading avatar images
+ Changed the truncation of project titles and task titles on the desktop slightly to prevent http://collabtive.o-dyn.de/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=8750#p17251

+ Files: Made listview/gridview switch respect the currently selected folder when switching views

+ When editing tasks or projects in tables (i.e. on the desktop) the edit form is now displayed in the top block where the add project/task form is also displayed. This eliminates the need for a dedicated "edit" page.
+ Enabled multi-byte safe truncation for strings (makes PHP extension "mbstring" required)
+ Properly enforce user permissions for uploading files, moving files (file_edit), deleting folders (file_del), adding folders (file_add) on the controller/script level. Not only on the template/view level.
+ Added RTL enabled version of the default theme. Contributed by mrawi.
+ Implemented "view" permission. It enables you to define roles that can only view certain parts of a project. For example a role that can view milestones, tasks and messages,  but not files and the timetracker in a project.
+ Added "Add task" slider to the "my tasks" block on the desktop. This way a user can add tasks to himself straight from the desktop.
+ Fix shading of the content table. When clicking "add task" or "add project" on the desktop the table with existing tasks / projects is now correctly shaded.
+ Made the page update.php translatable
+ Improved the design of the installer/updater
+ Fixed a notice in system administration / user profile when a language string was not translated

+ Substituted deprecated PHP function split() used in e-mail handling by PHP function explode()
+ Made sure to only offer the password reset function (via e-mail) when e-mail notifications are activated

+ Set sensible defaults for time formating in admin->system

+ Removed some dead code paths from manageproject.php
+ Added a security check to install.php to prevent it from being used after Collabtive has already been installed.
